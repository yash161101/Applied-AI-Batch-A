# Applied AI - Batch A ðŸ¦¾

This repository contains lecture notes, code examples, and interactive demos for various topics in AI and programming demonstrated in class. 
Below, you'll find a list of topics covered along with links to relevant resources.

## Setting up Environment 
- Create a conda virtual environment: `conda create --name aai_code python=3.12`
- Activate the enviroment: `conda activate aai_code`
- Install requirements in environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Topics and Resources

### Topic 1: Object Oriented Programming

- **Lecture Notes**: [Object Oriented Programming - Lecture Notes](https://github.com/yash161101/Applied-AI-Batch-A/blob/main/oops/oop_notes.ipynb)
  - Comprehensive notes covering the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This resource will help you understand key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, class methods, and inheritance.

- **Kaggle Example - Titanic Problem**: [Titanic Problem Solved with OOP](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yash161101/topic-1-object-oriented-programming)
  - An example demonstrating how to apply Object Oriented Programming principles to solve the Titanic problem on Kaggle. This example showcases the practical application of OOP in data science and machine learning projects.

### Topic 2: Search Algorithms

- **search_algo_demo**: [Search Algorithm Demo](https://github.com/yash161101/Applied-AI-Batch-A/tree/main/search/search_algo_demo)
  - An interactive interface that creates a maze and visualizes how Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* search algorithms work in action. This demo is designed to help you understand how these search algorithms operate in a controlled environment.
  - To run this use `python > 3.12` and use the command `python main.py`

- **map_example**: [Search Algorithms with a Map of Paris](https://github.com/yash161101/Applied-AI-Batch-A/tree/main/search/map_example)
  - A practical example illustrating search algorithms applied to a real-world scenario using a map of the streets of Paris. This example demonstrates how search algorithms can be used to navigate and find paths in geographical data.

- **tictactoe**: [Adversarial Search with Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/yash161101/Applied-AI-Batch-A/tree/main/search/tictactoe)
  - An interactive example explaining adversarial search through a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This resource includes an interface that shows how algorithms can be used to play optimally in adversarial environments.
  - To run this use the command `python runner.py`

- **search_notes**: [Search - Lecture Notes](https://github.com/yash161101/Applied-AI-Batch-A/blob/main/search/search_notes.ipynb)
  - A collection of generic code snippets for implementing various search algorithms. This resource provides a foundational understanding of how to code search algorithms from scratch.

Happy Coding!
